# adult-income-prediction project

Problem Statement:

The dataset contains different features like age,gender,education,occupation,capital-gain,capital-loss,race,work per hour,country etc. The proposed approach will implement a different techniques and algorithms like Random Forest and Boosting Techniques. Random Forest performed well with 86% accuracy. After we have done it is deployed on Heroku platform.

Approach used
  This is basically a binary classification problem where a person is classified into the >50K group or <=50K group
 
 Data Exploration     : I started exploring dataset using pandas,numpy and pandas-profiling. 

 Data visualization   : Ploted graphs to get insights about dependend and independed variables. 

 Feature Engineering  :  Removed missing values and created new features as per insights.

 Model Selection I    : Tested all base models to check the base accuracy, Also ploted residual plot to check whether a model is a good fit or not.

 Pickle File          :  Selected model as per best accuracy and created pickle file .
